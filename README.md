**NOTE: Agouti is no longer actively maintained. This was one of my earliest Go projects, and I am no longer happy with the API design. I recommend selecting an alternative WebDriver client for Go.**

Agouti is a library for writing browser-based acceptance tests in Google Go. It provides [Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) matchers and plays nicely with [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) or [Spec](https://github.com/sclevine/spec). See [agouti.org](http://agouti.org) and the [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/robomotionio/agouti) for documentation. Have questions? Check out the [Agouti mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/agouti) or the #agouti IRC channel on Freenode.

The [integration tests](https://github.com/robomotionio/agouti/blob/master/internal/integration/) are a great place to see everything in action and get started quickly!
